<!-- TEASER_END --> 

> I've been playing against a fair few cannon rushes in the new patch, and I keep seeing people ask how to defend them. This might not be the only viable way to defend cannon rushes, but in my case I've found it to be the most reliable.
> 
> Scout after your second gas, you should see the probe. Immediately go to block wherever their probe is, this is an uncommon scout timing unless they are cannon rushing. Cancel your second gas and saturate your first one 3/3. As soon as he plants a pylon down, pull 3 more probes. Use them like so:
> 
> * Probe 1: Chase and a click the enemy probe.
> 
> * Probe 2/3: Patrol around the initial pylon with these probes, so he can't simcity cannons around his pylon.
> 
> * Probe 4: Go to the most likely location for the follow up probe (usually at your lowground natural).
> 
> Here the cannon rusher has to make a decision, abandon the rush, or go hard. If they go hard you need to be ready to pull mroe probes. You only need about 6 probes on minerals and 3 probes on gas to afford zealot/zealot/stalker from your gateway. Pull all the rest that you need to block wall locations and surround cannons. Each cannon requires 4 probes on it, or a zealot.
> 
> Make your 2nd pylon before your cyber, you can afford it and you really don't want to get supply blocked. @100% gateway chronoboost a zealot and make a cyber, you should be able to get 2 zealots and a stalker out. The push should be pretty much over once your stalker gets out, a cannon shouldn't have made it to completion if you did this defense properly.
> 
> I've seen people around here talk about shield batteries, but I like to stop it dead in its track and I think with a little practice this defence is very reliable.
